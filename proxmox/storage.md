## 📦 Proxmox Storage Overview

Proxmox supports multiple types of storage backends:

| Storage Type  | Thin Provisioning | Snapshots      | Format Level | Common Use                              |
| ------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Directory** | ❌ (unless qcow2)  | ✅ (with qcow2) | File-level   | Backups, ISOs, lightweight VM disks     |
| **LVM**       | ❌                 | ❌              | Block-level  | Legacy block storage, no thin provision |
| **LVM-Thin**  | ✅                 | ✅              | Block-level  | Efficient VM disk storage               |
| **ZFS**       | ✅ (via ZVOL)      | ✅              | Block + File | Advanced use, snapshots, replication    |
| **NFS/CIFS**  | Depends           | Depends        | Network FS   | Shared storage, backups                 |
| **Ceph**      | ✅                 | ✅              | Distributed  | High-availability clusters              |

## 🗂️ 1. Directory-Based Storage

### Description:

* Treats a mounted disk/folder as a normal directory.
* Proxmox stores `.qcow2` or `.raw` files inside that directory.

### Use Case:

* External HDDs like `/mnt/laptop-hdd`, `/mnt/pc-hdd`
* Simple setups
* No need for advanced LVM features

### Pros:

* Easy to set up
* Supports file-level access
* Can store multiple content types: VM disks, ISOs, backups, etc.

### Cons:

* No native thin provisioning (unless qcow2 format)
* Slower than block-based storage in some cases

### Proxmox config sample:

```ini
dir: laptop-hdd
    path /mnt/laptop-hdd
    content iso,backup,images
```

---

## 💾 2. LVM (Logical Volume Manager)

### Description:

* Creates physical volumes (PVs) and volume groups (VGs) over block devices.
* You then create logical volumes (LVs) for VM disks.

### Use Case:

* Traditional VM disk allocation
* Where thin provisioning is not required

### Pros:

* Robust block-level access
* Reliable and mature

### Cons:

* **No snapshots**
* **No thin provisioning**
* Consumes full space on allocation

### Proxmox config sample:

```ini
lvm: my-lvm
    vgname myvg
    content images
```

---

## 🪶 3. LVM-Thin

### Description:

* An enhancement of LVM with a thin pool (`lvcreate -T`).
* Allows over-provisioning and snapshots.

### Use Case:

* Modern VM disk storage
* Fast cloning, snapshots, space efficiency

### Pros:

* Thin provisioning
* Fast snapshots
* Good performance

### Cons:

* Slightly complex to set up
* Not file-level accessible (block storage)

### Proxmox config sample:

```ini
lvmthin: my-thin-storage
    thinpool mythinpool
    vgname myvg
    content rootdir,images
```

## 🔌 External Drives in Proxmox

### 1. When attached as Directory:

* Mount to `/mnt/laptop-hdd`
* Add in Proxmox as `dir` type
* Can store ISOs, backups, and `.qcow2` VM images
* Easy to use

### 2. When attached as LVM/LVM-Thin:

* Format disk (`/dev/sdX`)
* Create VG and Thin Pool
* Add as `lvm` or `lvmthin` type
* Better for long-term VM storage (snapshots, clones)

### Example Disk Setup (LVM-Thin):

```bash
pvcreate /dev/sdb
vgcreate myvg /dev/sdb
lvcreate -L 900G -T myvg/mythinpool
```

## 🏗️ What Gets Stored Where

| Storage Type | VM Disks             | Snapshots    | ISOs | Backups | Templates |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------------ | ---- | ------- | --------- |
| Directory    | ✅ `.qcow2` or `.raw` | ✅ (if qcow2) | ✅    | ✅       | ✅         |
| LVM          | ✅ Raw LVs            | ❌            | ❌    | ❌       | ❌         |
| LVM-Thin     | ✅ Thin LVs           | ✅            | ❌    | ❌       | ❌         |

## 📌 Best Practices

* **Backups / ISOs** → Use **Directory**
* **Fast VM provisioning** → Use **LVM-Thin**
* **Simple storage (external HDD)** → Use **Directory**
* **Snapshots & Clones** → Use **LVM-Thin** or **ZFS**

## ⚙️ CLI Quick Commands

### Identify your disk:

```bash
lsblk
```

### Mount as Directory:

```bash
mkdir /mnt/laptop-hdd
mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/laptop-hdd
```

### Convert to LVM-Thin:

```bash
wipefs -a /dev/sdX
pvcreate /dev/sdX
vgcreate myvg /dev/sdX
lvcreate -L 900G -T myvg/mythinpool
```

## 🚀 Performance Factors: SSD vs HDD

| **Drive Type** | **Performance** | **Latency** | **IOPS (I/O operations/sec)** |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| **SSD**        | High            | Low         | Very high                     |
| **HDD**        | Low             | High        | Low                           |

So **SSD is always faster** than HDD, no matter which storage format you use.

## 🧱 Storage Format: LVM vs LVM-Thin

| **Storage Format** | **Thin Provisioning** | **Snapshot Support** | **Performance Impact**        |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **LVM**            | ❌ No                  | ❌ No                 | Raw performance               |
| **LVM-Thin**       | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes                | Slight overhead from metadata |

> 🧠 Note: LVM-Thin adds flexibility but **may add minor latency overhead** due to metadata operations, especially on HDDs.

## ⚖️ Final Performance Comparison Matrix

| **Storage Type**    | **Speed Rank** | **Notes**                                |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **LVM-Thin on SSD** | 🥇 Fastest     | Best mix of speed and flexibility        |
| **LVM on SSD**      | 🥈 Very Fast   | No overhead, but lacks flexibility       |
| **LVM on HDD**      | 🥉 Slower      | Limited by disk RPM and seek time        |
| **LVM-Thin on HDD** | 🐌 Slowest     | Overhead of thin provisioning + slow HDD |

---

## 🔍 Summary

* **Changing from directory to LVM-Thin will NOT speed up your VM** if the underlying disk is still a **slow HDD**.
* The **biggest boost comes from moving to an SSD**, regardless of format.
* **LVM-Thin on SSD** is generally the best choice for balancing speed and advanced features like snapshots and thin provisioning.
